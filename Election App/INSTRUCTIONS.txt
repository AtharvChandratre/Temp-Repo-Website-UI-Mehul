src/index.html has all the index stuff

src/js/add.js has the Web3.js data

contracts/Election.sol has the smart contract

build/contracts/Election.json has that massive JSON file which has all the data. But you probably won't need it as there are getters in place for all the things needed in the smart contract itself.
